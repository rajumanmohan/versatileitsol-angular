					Disjointed systems and rigid software have led to many problems over the years. Not just for
					employees who use
					this software, but to the entire business. The lack of agility and freedom of movement had caused a
					lack of
					productivity and access to information.<br>
					When we undertake an integration project, we understand you want the power to get a unified view of
					the task
					on hand.
				</p>
				<p>
					We want to help you imagine your digital CX, work productively and run smoothly. Here are some of
					the
					integrations we offer.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>Platform integration</strong>
						: With all the different platforms and software we use, it can get confusing and
						breakages can be recognized at times. Within this, we offer integration of web services - from
						service
						oriented architectures (SOA) to remote procedure call (RPC)

					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Data Integration</strong>
						: When integrating platforms such as .NET and/or Java EE - we are able to use, extract and
						manipulate data. Within XML, it involves metadata management.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Component Integration</strong>
						: Integrations at business logic level such as transaction management or application
						services that use architectures like SOAP/SML or EJB/Struts framework.

					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Process Integration</strong>
						: This involves the process and workflow modeling approach to integration using a process
						oriented thinking or BPM.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Here are some of the benefits of integrations:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Data flow: Now that all your applications communicate with each other or are combined into
						bigger apps
						with more functionality - data for each use case is readily available and is more comprehensive
						in nature.
					</li>
					<li>Improved productivity as communications and information flow in a more streamlined manner.
						Access to
						relevant people are given and they have no issue with accessing, modifying and using data as per
						necessary.
					</li>
					<li>Real-time information: Since all the data is now compiled and presented, stay updated with all
						your
						business needs in real-time. Process can be automated and/or smoothed out as requirement.</li>

					Just as comfortable as you are getting with your services and applications -it might be time to
					upgrade! As a
					trusted service provider, we have seen cases where upgrades are not done on time, which lead to huge
					impacts
					to the business.
				</p>
				<p>
					As technologies and expectations advance, you have to develop and upgrade at the same pace to be
					able to
					handle current and future challenges that may arise.
				</p>
				<p>
					With our end-to-end upgrade process, we are here to help you evaluate what needs to be upgraded,
					what the
					timelines and business impacts are/will be followed by a detailed outlook on the roadmap.
				</p>
				<p>Here are three reasons why businesses upgrade and modernize:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>Slower than normal processing time</strong>
						: When machines are unable to keep up to human need, it causes a major
						time lag and gap in communication and process flow.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong> Bad UX</strong>
						: As times have changed, what a user wants has been central and most important when updates are
						made.
						With the changing time, UX is now being kept at the core and software are giving the user more
						of what they
						want.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong> Lack of scalability</strong>
						: Sometimes we’ve run into situations where the entire solution can’t be built
						upon/improved/scaled; therefore leading us to have to modernize the existing solution and having
						to ensure
						the company is on par with tech in the market.

					As we have moved into a generation of swiftness and updated technology - everything has compressed
					into the
					size of our palms - our phones.
				</p>
				<p>
					From iOS to Android to Windows Phone till a Blackberry, your data will be connected, updated and
					available
					wherever you are. On all devices, available globally!
				</p>
				<p>
					Enterprise mobile and web apps allow you to access and use the information available on these
					software-heavy
					applications which reside on your computer at work, wherever, whenever.
				</p>
				<p>
					To begin with, enterprise web apps are lite-versions of what you see on a computer - allowing you
					the full
					flexibility available.
				</p>
				<p>
					Next, when it comes to content and documentation - creating, sharing and storage - it can be a
					tedious task,
					especially when you have to access it on the go. With an updated content accessibility - you can now
					find,
					use, update documents on the go or when you’re comfortable.
				</p>
				<p>As part of the enterprise plans, we offer benefits to our customers such as onsite business analysis,
					digital
					transformation and post-development support.</p>
				<p>Beginning with the onsite business analysis, we visit your office location and look, understand and
					grasp the
					processes. Then, we take a call on the kind of technology that would suit your need and size.</p>
				<p>Digital transformation is an ongoing process which allows tech solutions to get added to your stack
					with the
					goal that it fits culture, operations and budget.
					Post-development support is an ongoing offering wherein we ensure tech and business needs go hand in
					hand,
					staying updated and fresh always!
				</p>
				<p>
					To sum it all up, apart from the usage aspect of these enterprise web and mobile applications,
					security is
					always of prime concern. With our range of expertise, we are able to build a system for you with
					permission
					control for data access and a cloud server for retrieval of the same. This ensures that no data is
					leaked/stolen from sources of access.
					Keep your data safe when on-the-go!
