          Wearable devices or smart electronic devices - your FitBit/Apple Watch are now central to discussions about
          IoT! These help wearers gain better control over their health outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          These wearable devices have the same computing power of mobile phones and laptops, sometimes even
          outperforming the devices completely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wearable technology has three layers
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The sensors that monitor movement, temperature, heart rate and so on
          </li>
          <li>
            The connect and control layer - this has bluetooth capabilities and wifi, for example
          </li>
          <li>
            The cloud layer where information is stored and read.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          For consumers, IoT spans a variety of pain-points such as battery life and connectivity. Within the domain of
          battery life, IoT can optimize and report back on the battery usage trends and modes of operations. Within the
          section of connectivity, IoT can work with tech to ensure reliable wireless connectivity where issues such as
          multi-radio interference (co-channel or adjacent channel) can become problematic.
        </p>
        <p>Wearable devices communicate with smart phones over a number of real-time communication technologies
          including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Bluetooth 2.0
          </li>
          <li>
            BLE API or low energy Bluetooth
          </li>
          <li>
            RFID
          </li>
          <li>
            WiFi/WLAN or 802.11
          </li>
          <li>
            915 MHz
          </li>
        </ul>

          Hospitals and doctors aren’t something that patients look forward to. It is an industry that has been plagued
          with traditional service practices and even technology.
        </p>
        <p>Quantified and data based healthcare is going to be the future of the industry because health that is
          measurable can be better improved. </p>
        <p>
          Given the introduction for IoT, we can together cause changes that make doctor-patient interactions personal
          and efficient again.
        </p>
        <p>Most hospitals or locations where patient-doctor interactions occur use IoT because of the cost reduction.
          With specialists using remote health monitoring facilities - they are able to provide treatment in more
          real-time. </p>
        <p>
          IoT has a plethora of benefits such as more accurate treatment results, disease control within the hospital,
          medicine control and many more. Within prevention, it has become a primary area of focus as health care
          expenses are projected to grow unmanageable in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          When hospitals use IoT, they are guaranteed more hygienic environments.
          When patients use IoT, they are able to transmit information in real-time to the doctors
          When doctors use IoT, they are able to diagnose situations with more care and accuracy, most importantly,
          speed.
        </p>
        <p>Some of the usecases of IoT in healthcare are</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Disease Prevention</strong> - This enables doctors to check in on patients regularly, ensuring their
            health is under control, in regular intervals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Healthcare Management</strong>
            - This is managing the end-to-end consumer experience. From the time of check-in till check-out. Managing it
            with IoT gives us far deeper insights and data which we can use to understand our customers better.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Patient Administration and Billing</strong>
            - This is specifically to do with the entire billing process. Billing
            usually takes time and IoT speeds up the process!
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          IoT connects your health with the future. It has the ability to align towards the shared goals of better
          patient health, lower healthcare costs and improved doctor-patient experience for all stakeholders.

          IoT within transportation and automobiles is transforming the way we view fleet management. With the ability
          to gather, understand and use more data - we are becoming ever so aware of key metrics that we were unable to
          track before.
        </p>
        <p>
          For fleets and fleet management, IoT is pushing the throttle on productivity and efficiency of vehicles. From
          monitoring and optimizing routes till controlling the fuel costs - IoT is enabling smarter decisions. All this
          leads to a cost cutting that’s commonly associated with inefficiencies in logistics.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to the security angle, IoT offers high-level security metrics and tracking for the driver and
          vehicle itself - with the ability to alert a designated individual in case of an emergency. This keeps fleet
          managers aware and able to handle emergencies swiftly.
        </p>
        <p>When IoT-enabled cars are on the road, there will be much more data in regards to driving, video/audio and
          advanced views. These smart vehicles will be able to ‘see’ blind turns and corners at a distance, identify
          pedestrians, cyclists, and any other road hazards well in advance, and make complicated but automatic judgment
          calculations and split-second decisions to maximize human safety.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Insurance</strong> :
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The next layer would be insurance premiums on vehicles that do dent the pockets of not just large fleet
            owners but also individuals. IoT in this case, merged with Insurance, is actually working for the customer -
            by providing accurate, real-time data on driving behavior and trends to the company. This, when communicated
            back, allows for the insurance company to not generalize the offering/service - but personalise it instead.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p> The ability to track and receive updates about the freight has made fleet management easier for executives.
          Using IoT technologies, the entire transportation company has improved their performance, safety, and
          communication with customers eventually helping executives to make quick decisions. Transport, Logistics and
          Fleet management companies use IoT technology in order to increase efficiency and productivity of
          operations. Their goal to enhance the way operations take place has succeeded!</p>

          IoT within retail is a much-needed addition to tackle tedious, traditional tasks. IoT is set to modernize
          retail by being an inventory management system, a payment gateway/management system and finally, making retail
          more customer obsessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          IoT works within the retail environment by segregating a function and then figuring out how to optimize for
          productivity. Take for example supply chain, this task currently involves a lot of physical stock counting.
          Smart shelf systems contain three elements: an RFID tag, an RFID reader, and an antenna. Smart shelves are
          capable of automatically monitoring inventory and send managers alerts

        </p>
        <p>
          When IoT is integrated, items picked from shelves will be automatically recorded, deducted from inventory and
          if stock is low - reordered. It is full-cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Smart shelves take an important part in giving intelligent insights into customer behavior to the store
          manager and/or owner.
        </p>
        <p>Next, think the shopping experience - everyone loves personalised discounts! In this instance, if a product
          is looked for online, in-store IoT, which is synched with the user’s loyalty account, will send them a
          personal in-store discount! This will encourage them to visit the store more often, and by connecting online
          with offline - filling in the lost money that has been going missing for years.</p>
        <p>
          With the final step in the process, checkout, IoT can enable customers to just walk through a gate where the
          codes are scanned. Once scanned, the money auto deducts from their wallet - leading to a zero-human check out
          process. This also makes the entire population in-store more controlled and offers a massive uptick in the in
          to out time of customers.
