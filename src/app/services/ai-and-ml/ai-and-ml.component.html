        <p>Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence are the need of the hour! It's one of the many ways that
          companies have become smart by using data to better serve customers, And improve their own products.</p>
        <p>When it comes to Artificial Intelligence it's all about training a computer to work more efficiently and
          better than a human could. AI is created to make decisions and understand data points that correlate- these
          form a logical conclusion to any problem. Therefore, the use of AI leads to higher intelligence or wisdom or
          as we call it, insight into actions.</p>
        <p>Machine learning is a subset of AI. It is the best method to automatically analyze, understand and identify
          patterns within data. Machine Learning is, therefore, the second aspect of a project where the computer learns
          from the insights and behaviours it's trained to follow. Here the goal is to increase the accuracy of data
          understanding. </p>
        <p>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. It is much more complex and therefore refers to the number of
          layers in a neural network. The more layers of deep learning, the more complex the understandings.</p>
        <p>What makes the difference between ML and DL? - ML requires structured data to be presented, whereas DL
          requires a complex algorithm where layers of the ANN - artificial neural networks are activated.</p>

          Within organisations, machine learning can be an asset within any department. With the ability to understand
          data and crunch and derive value from it - sales, marketing, operations; there's an opportunity to understand
          data points more deeply.
        </p>
        <p>

          With ML, there is a custom need and methodology per organization to derive the necessary solutions and
          insights. At Versatile, we have learned the languages and modules necessary to build out a custom solution for
          you, from scratch.

        </p>
        <p>
          Within ML there are 4 main steps - developing the algorithm, training, tuning and then deploying at scale.

        </p>
        <p>
          When developing the ML algorithm, our team of experts creates rules, creates norms and exclusions - teaching
          the system how to understand data.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next step, training is where we input the linkages and correlations - this helps the algorithm understand
          structured and unstructured data. The next, tuning, is where we analyse what we have and fix the bugs and gaps
          so that your data is consistently accurate. The final step, deployment helps introduce ML to your existing
          application, making sure the transition is smooth and integration works as intended.
        </p>
        <p>Our highly-proficient machine learning experts enrich standard machine learning development models using
          custom data preprocessing scripts by vectorizing data, removing correlations and outliers. By uploading
          prepared datasets, our developer team aligns the machine learning model with your objectives.</p>
        <p>Some of the platforms we are trained in are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Google Cloud AI
          </li>
          <li>
            Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services
          </li>
          <li>
            Amazon AWS Machine Learning
          </li>
          <li>
            IBM Watson Machine Learning
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>An example of the languages we are experts within:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>R Languages</li>
          <li>C++</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Given that there is a multitude of industries ML can be introduced within, the possibilities of success are
          endless.

          Now that we understand what ML is, AI is focused in and around all the use cases where ML needs to be used to
          gather and AI, to understand data.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the premier use cases of AI is for NLP - or Natural Language Processing. It revolves around
          understanding and manipulating human language - English, for example. NLP is used to make computers read the
          text, hear speech, interpret it and measure sentiment. Within NLP comes features and functions like contextual
          extraction, sentiment analysis, summarization of documents or even translation!
        </p>
        <p>
          Within imagery, AI can understand, capture and use the information for various purposes. By understanding
          items such as colours, patterns, and shapes of the image, AI can extract relevant data without human
          intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, segmenting them by face, like the iPhone does currently till restoring and enhancing images that need
          to be fixed. AI has plenty of applications. Further, more advanced is image detection - this can help in say
          gathering images from identity cards where they need to be gathered for verification.
        </p>
        <p>
          For businesses, AI is used to build chatbot applications that can act as a front-facing figure to your
          business. Here they can obtain rich data to understand user behaviour and provide uninterrupted customer
          services to users 24x7. Apart from carrying out scripted conversations, bots and AI together can act as an
          operator too - forwarding and tagging relevant people in conversations via channelling.
        </p>
        <p>Our goal is to ensure that you are empowered by Artificial Intelligence within your use cases - be it
          customer support, sales, marketing and more!. </p>
        <p>Here are some of the skills we possess:</p>

          Data science helps enterprises make data-driven decisions, optimising decisions, reducing costs and finding
          new ways to use resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          When working with data science, it allows business owners and stakeholders to analyze, visualize and report on
          data points with ease offering a 360-degree view of a business. Real-life business problems are solved
          intuitively, and realistically to support decision making.

        </p>
        <p>
          Within data science, the data part of this process/activity is in millions of points/bytes. For companies, it
          is a strategy that collects and analyzes large amounts of data/bytes to uncover patterns, the existing
          correlations, individual customer preferences, and other vital information that can assist businesses to make
          informed decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first and most important step in data science is to develop an architecture that works across departments
          and functions. Our consultants help utilise structured and unstructured data that will help your business
          grow, keeping in mind your current capabilities.

        </p>
        <p>Once we've built the architecture and linkages, the next part would be automation functions where data can be
          grabbed, studied and understood for the use case. Be it reading a blog, or understanding audio files - big
          data can clean, validate, understand, harmonize and verify data.

          Deep learning relates to artificial neural networks that are composed of many layers. It is a domain that is
          motivated by intuition, theoretical arguments from circuit theory, empirical results, and current knowledge of
          neuroscience. Digital-native businesses have been more responsive towards implementing deep learning than more
          traditional industries like manufacturing or retail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the applications of deep learning are demand prediction, fraud detection, image recognition, speech
          recognition and NLP. Basically, intelligent utilization of data sets can help grow business operations,
          improve productivity and enable accelerated business outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Why did deep learning become so famous?</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Amount of data available. From mobile phones to tablets to desktop, there is an innumerous amount of data
            companies and software have about you. Combined with the internet and things like AI - we are able to
            understand, aggregate and use data with deep learning to gather insight and data points to help solve for a
            problem.
          </li>
          <li>Developments in processor architecture have allowed a massive speedup of mathematical matrix operations.
            Items such as the Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) that was optimized for gaming, can now be leveraged for
            neural networks. With developed computational power neural networks have, it can increase significantly in
            size, adding to their mighty power within models. This expansion is done by adding “layers”, inspiring the
            name deep learning.</li>
