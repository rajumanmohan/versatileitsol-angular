          As the use of mobile phones has become widespread and common, the demand for mobile apps has risen. Mobile
          apps give the user the flexibility to access and use the application from anywhere, anytime. The flexibility
          it offers is unparalleled.
        </p>
        <p>

          To be relevant in the market, presence on mobile app is absolutely essential as customers are now on-the-go.

        </p>
        <p>
          To begin this process to develop a cutting edge mobile app, we go through a rigorous process to understand
          your business needs and your target audience. Then, we start conceptualizing the app as it’s going to be.
          Then, move on to the design, development, deployment and post-launch maintenance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years we have absorbed proven agile development techniques and a strategic DevOps deployment
          process, in order to reduce uncertainty and consistently deliver secure and stable applications for our
          clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given that phones are now available in different sizes, our apps have to be dynamic and responsive - an area
          we are very comfortable with. We have experience within a multitude of languages, frameworks and optimisation
          strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keeping in mind industry trends and advancements in tech, we ensure that all your requirements are met today
          and in the future. Scalability in apps is also something we take great care of - we want your app to be used
          by 1,1000 and 10000+ users.
        </p>
        <p>When building a mobile app for you, we are flexible with the language you wish to use. We offer native mobile
          development for iOS and Android, Additionally we have expertise within cross-platform development tools such
          as Cordova/PhoneGap, Xamarin, React Native.</p>

          An Ionic app is one that can be used on any mobile operating system. Created in 2013 it has given more power
          to developers to speed up processes and release builds faster. It is also a cost effective solution for a
          single developer as they can cross-platform build.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traditionally, Android used to be developed using Java or Kotlin and iOS using Swift or Objective C. Since
          Ionic has been introduced, HTML5 and AngularJS have taken over, and ionic functions as a single code-base but
          cross-platform integration.
          With Ionic apps, no matter the language, HTML5, JavaScript, AngularJS, it is created for longevity and highly
          functionality.


        </p>
        <p>
          By that, we mean, it reduces the initial workload on developers since this kind of development is open source.
          And secondly, it is a compiled code solution using Phonegap and Cordova/Capacitor which gives way for code to
          be written once and still usable on iOS or Android.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ionic has a range of default CSS and JS parts that handle all kinds of interactions you’d need - from shapes,
          to sliding boxes to highlights and micro-interactions. Using CSS as a base, we can build on top of that,
          creating something unique for you and your solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          A major advantage of ionic apps is that it reduces the time to market - since there is increased productivity
          and few changes, along with agile development, it is a quicker design to ship process.
        </p>
        <p>
          These hybrid apps that we develop are high quality, user friendly, fast and has a low probability of glitches.

          With wearable apps, it's on your wrist and is the most compact form of an app you'd see. We have experience
          with developing apps for smartwatches and bands - both used to help enterprises and individuals get custom
          solutions for their use case.
        </p>
        <p>
          The balance between a simple user interface (UI) and a power-packed bunch of functionalities leads to a great
          Wearable device user experience (UX).

        </p>
        <p>
          Our apps have been delivered on Apple Watch, Android Wear, & other smart gadgets.

        </p>
        <p>
          Iphone & Android: Just like on your phone, we have developed apps that fit on your wrist for both operating
          devices. These apps are designed to be 'essential only' and have only the most prominent features. These apps
          are tweaked for accessibility and usability - since it is space crunched. Using some of the same features of
          development for a mobile app, these wearable apps only take it a step further.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the use cases we've built wearable apps for is fitness. These apps are used to keep track of an
          individual's health. Here the key tracking metrics, are steps, hours active, sleep...so on and so forth. These
          apps are made bare-bones for devices they're used on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another being utility-based apps - so the regular messaging, calling, texting, text to speech, calculators.
          These utility apps are created so that information can be accessed, crunched, and, used with speed and
          accuracy.
        </p>
        <P>Versatile's team of experts are industry ready to build wearable apps for global clients. Our team enjoys the
          challenge of customization and look forward to being a part of your business growth story. We have mastered
          the art of attractive visuals with in user interfaces!</P>
